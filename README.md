# Cricket ball aerodynamics

## Description
Welcome to my project! This project delves into the fascinating principles of aerodynamics that dictate the movements of a cricket ball. For all the years of my witnessing cricket and the enthralling spectacle that is fast bowling, I found that despite the immense popularity of cricket, many fans remain unaware of the scientific principles behind fast bowling. This gap in understanding often leads to the acceptance of myths and misconceptions.

## Objective
The aim of this project is to spread awareness and knowledge about the movement of a cricket ball, showing that it is grounded in classical aerodynamic principles rather than myth or magic. By compiling research on this topic, this project presents a structured and detailed explanation of the science behind cricket ball movements. This project aims to educate cricket enthusiasts, providing them with a deeper understanding of the game they love. It discusses various topics starting from the cricket ball itself to its various types of movements and then finally ending with some myth-busters. All the principles are also demonstrated in forms of videos and there is a quiz at the end to see if you've finally learnt about the science behind it. Explore the science, enjoy the videos, and test your knowledge with the quiz at the end. Happy learning!
